# Car-Management-system-with-SQL-No-SQL-servers-integration

AOA, I have created a console based Car Parking Project written in Java Language for my OOP final Project. THe project can enter the number of vehicles that have entered 
into the building for parking, you can view the records, delete the records, view the records of individual types of vehicles i.e. Rickshaws, cars and buses and you can
delete the records of all the vehicles as well as individuals records. I have uploaded the project proposal, report and problems because of which i created this software.


Integrations with SQL-server and for No-SQL we used MongoDB and demonstration can be viewd for help in Project Report pdf.
